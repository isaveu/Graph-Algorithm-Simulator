# Graph-Algorithm-Simulator
Description:
Interactively apply and visualize how graph algorithm works.

How it Works:
1. Setup up nodes by clicking on Canvas.
2. Setup edges by dragging pointer from one node to another.
3. Enter weight of each Edge. 
4. Run Algorithm.
5. See Results and explore all the tools and options.

Algorithms Implemented:
1. Floyd Warshall
2. Dijkstra Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm
