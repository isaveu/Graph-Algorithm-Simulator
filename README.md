# Graph-Algorithm-Simulator
Description:
Interactively apply and visualize how graph algorithm works.

Algorithm Implemented:  Dijkstra Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm

How To Run:
1. Run Python IDLE (for Python 3)
2. Open file Dijkstra's Simulator.py.
3. Run Module
4. Enjoy

How it Works:
1. Setup up nodes by clicking on Canvas.
2. Setup edges by dragging pointer from one node to another.
3. Enter weight of each Edge. 
4. Run Algorithm.
5. See Results and explore all the tools and options.
